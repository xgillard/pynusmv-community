'''
This module contains all the mining-related functionalities. These 
functions compute nothing per themselves (except trivial stuffs) and rely on 
core to do the heavy lifting.

    Mines the most frequent patterns in each of the `clusters` of the `graph`

    information

        might want to call that instead.
